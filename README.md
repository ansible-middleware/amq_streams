## Installation

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install middleware_automation.amq_streams

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: middleware_automation.amq_streams
```

The amq_streams collection also depends on the following python packages to be present on the controller host:

* _none at the moment_

A requirement file is provided to install:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Build and install locally

Clone the repository, checkout the tag you want to build, or pick the main branch for the development version; then:

    ansible-galaxy collection build .
    ansible-galaxy collection install middleware_automation-amq_streams-*.tar.gz

## Usage

### Install Playbook

* [`playbooks/playbook.yml`](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq_streams/blob/main/playbooks/playbook.yml) deploys based on the collections defaults.

For full service configuration details, refer to each role README file:

* [Common Role](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq_streams/blob/main/roles/amq_streams_common/README.md)
* [Zookeeper Role](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq_streams/blob/main/roles/amq_streams_zookeeper/README.md)
* [Broker Role](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq_streams/blob/main/roles/amq_streams_broker/README.md)
* [Connect Role](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq_streams/blob/main/roles/amq_streams_connect/README.md)


#### Offline installation

Making the `amq_streams_common_archive_file` archive available to the playbook working directory, and setting
`amq_streams_common_offline_install` to `True`, allows to skip the download tasks. The `amq_streams_common_download_dir` path
for the archive does match the downloaded archive path, so that it is also used as a cache when multiple hosts are
provisioned in a cluster.

```yaml
  vars:
    amq_streams_common_offline_install: true
    amq_streams_common_download_dir: "/tmp"
```

#### Install from alternate sources

It is possible to perform downloads from alternate sources (like corporate Nexus, Artifactory, proxy, etc), using the
`amq_streams_common_download_url` variable; make sure the final downloaded filename matches with the source filename
described by the `amq_streams_common_archive_file` variable (ie. *kafka_-a.b.c-x.y.z.tgz*).
