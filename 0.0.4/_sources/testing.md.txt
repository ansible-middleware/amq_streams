# Testing

## Continuous integration

The collection is tested with a [molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule) setup covering the included roles and verifying correct installation and idempotence.
In order to run the molecule tests locally with python 3.9 available, after cloning the repository:

```shell
pip install yamllint 'molecule[docker]~=3.5.2' ansible-core flake8 ansible-lint voluptuous
molecule test --all
```

## Integration testing

Demo repositories which depend on the collection, and aggregate functionality with other middleware_automation collections, are automatically rebuilt
at every collection release to ensure non-breaking changes and consistent behaviour.

The repositories are:

 - none at the moment

## Test playbooks

Sample playbooks are provided in the `playbooks/` directory; to run the playbooks locally (requires a rhel system with python 3.9+, ansible, and systemd) the steps are as follows:

1. Setup environment

```shell
pip install ansible-core
```

2. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq_streams
cd amq_streams
```

3. Install collection dependencies

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

4. Install collection python deps

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create inventory for localhost

```shell
cat << EOF > inventory2
[amq_streams]
localhost ansible_connection=local
EOF
```

6. Run the playbook

```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/amq_streams.yml
```
